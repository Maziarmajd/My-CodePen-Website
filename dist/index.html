When two shots rang out, Bruce Wayne’s life changed forever. He pledged himself to justice and he has upheld that oath for years. Wearing many names—the Dark Knight, the World’s Greatest Detective, the Caped Crusader—he has battled tragic foes like The Joker, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and so many more. But deep inside, he knows that he shares something with them that most of humanity wouldn’t understand—a commitment to the fight.

              <p>When his parents were gunned down in front of him, young Bruce Wayne resolved to rid Gotham City of the criminal element that took their lives. He trained extensively to achieve mental and physical perfection, in addition to mastering martial arts, detective techniques, and criminal psychology. Dressing as a bat to prey on criminals’ fears, Batman fights crime with the aid of specialized gadgets and vehicles, operating out of his secretive Batcave below Wayne Manor.
